# ECG-image-classification
Here is my solution to [Physionet Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/). Solution is based on the Model described in paper [Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Electrocardiogram Classification
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06122) by Zihlmann et al. which was published following the authors' contribution to the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge.

## Results
* Model attained ~93% accuracy on all 4 classes.
* Model attained ~99% accuracy for classification of atrial fibrillation(AF) from other classes.
